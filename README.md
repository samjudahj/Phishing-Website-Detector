# Phishing-Website-Detector
Phishing Website Detector is a mini project that identifies whether a website URL is phishing or legitimate. The system analyzes URL features such as length, special characters, and HTTPS usage, then uses a machine learning model to make predictions. This project helps users avoid fake websites and improves online security awareness.
